# Track Progress from Interval Running
This is a little script to track and visualize your progress while doing interval training. The neccessary `.fit` files can be exported via services like Garmin Connect. Just collect all your interval workouts in a directory and execute the `main.py` script. To get comparable results the workouts should have similiar properties (e.g. interval length, route, warmup, length). Of course there are some other factors like fatigue or just daily fitness which can influence the tempo of your intervals, but all in all you should be abled to track if you are improving over time or not.

## TODO
- include heartrate in analysis
- allow other interval lengths
